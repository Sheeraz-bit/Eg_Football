Here I have a dynamic website of a football club with admin dashboard(you can change the content of the website from there). I created it using html, css, bootstrap, javascript, mysql, npm. when I wanted to deploy it I see to deploy the npm server costs 10000 rs per year, so I want to convert the server form npm to apache (xampp).@c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\FC Website\New Text Document.txt . So the aparches PID is 27368280 and port 80443. the mysql in xampp PID is 5150 and port is 3306. now give me all the list of required list of what other things you need to make this project run in php. now just convert this websites server from npm into xampp. and remeber don't change the design and any logic fro the project, I only need this project to be run in php because this project is perfect for now.



when the option 'dont show' is selecten in dashbord/fixture, the code hides the data or the ow of specific fixture to display on home page, fixture page. fixture with status 'don't show' is not displaing on any page. what to fix: when the fxture status 'dont show' the code should display it same as other fixtures but the difference only, we wanna display the text 'Participated'
